### Recent Research Contributions

1. **Creating Large Language Model Applications Utilizing Lang Chain - A Primer on Developing LLM Apps Fast**
    - This paper introduces LangChain, a framework designed for rapid development of applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights modular components like prompts, chains, and agents that enable seamless integration with diverse data sources and workflows. The study provides practical use cases such as autonomous agents and document-based Q&A, emphasizing LangChain’s ability to streamline AI-powered solutions in fields like education and customer support [1].

2. **A Study on the Implementation Method of an Agent-Based Advanced RAG System Using Graph**
    - This research proposes an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangGraph to overcome traditional RAG limitations. It introduces graph-based workflows for dynamic query rephrasing, real-time data integration, and improved decision-making to enhance response accuracy and relevance. The study demonstrates LangGraph’s scalability and practicality in enterprise applications, offering a strong foundation for next-generation generative AI systems [2].

3. **Easin, A. M., Sourav, S., & Tamás, O. (2024). An Intelligent LLM-Powered Personalized Assistant for Digital Banking Using LangGraph and Chain of Thoughts**
    - This paper proposes a personalized assistant for digital banking that leverages LangGraph and Chain of Thoughts (COT) prompting within a multi-agent framework. The system integrates features like fund transfers, bill payments, and FAQs, delivering efficient and interactive services. LangGraph structures data management through node-based workflows, while COT enhances logical reasoning, enabling agents to handle complex tasks. The proposed architecture improves user engagement, task efficiency, and overall service delivery in digital banking. The implementation details and results demonstrate the potential of this multi-agent framework in advancing digital banking technologies [3].
